**Hello there, I'm Vinh Tran** âœ¨

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineer. Recently, I started learning full-stack web development and I just fell in love with it. I love the moment when ideas starting to line up and come into life.

I've been programming ever since I was in 8th grade, with Pascal being my first ever language (it was taught in my country FOR SOME REASON). Despite its questionable practicality, I've grown used to thinking logically, writing, and optimizing computer algorithms. Prior to web developing, I worked with low-power embedded systems in my spare time; therefore, I'm looking forward to incorporating my skills to create an Internet of Things with online interfaces.

I like to keep my program's design simple and focus on functionality and user experience. I'm currently learning to utilize React to create even more robust applications.
