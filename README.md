**Hello there, I'm Vinh Tran** âœ¨

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineer. Recently, I started learning full-stack web developing and I just fell in love with it. I love the moment when ideas starting to line up and come into life. 

I've been programming ever since I was in 8th grade, with Pascal was my first ever language (it was taught in my country FOR SOME REASON). In spite of its practicality, I've grown used to thinking logically, writting, and optimizing computer algorithms. Prior to web developing, I worked on low-power embedded system; therefore, I'm looking forward to incorporate my skills to create Internet of Things with online interfaces.

I like to keep my program's design simple and focus on functionality and user experience. I'm currently learning to ultilize React to create even more robust applications.
